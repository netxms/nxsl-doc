== Instance()

****
[IMPORTANT]
====
*Deprecated in 5.0.*

Instead of using this function, just return an array with the following values:

1. instance (`{instance}` in DCIs)
2. instance name (`{instance-name}` in DCIs, optional)
3. related object (optional)

Unlike previous versions, `true` is not required as the first value in the array, since presence of the array itself is enough to accept the instance. However, old scripts with four values will still work.
