This section will help you write and run your first NXSL script. By the end, you'll understand the basic structure of NXSL programs and how to execute them in NetXMS.

== Hello World

Every programming journey starts with a simple program. Here's the classic "Hello World" in NXSL:

[source,c]
----
println("Hello, World!");
----

That's it! This single line prints text to the output. Let's break it down:

* `println` is a built-in function that prints text followed by a newline
* The text inside quotes `"Hello, World!"` is a string
* The semicolon `;` ends the statement (required in NXSL)

== Running Scripts in NetXMS

NXSL scripts run in several contexts within NetXMS. The most common ways to test scripts are:

**Script Console** (for testing)::
Access via _Configuration → Script Library_, create a new script, and use the _Execute_ button.

**Transformation Scripts** (for DCIs)::
Modify collected data before storing. Set in DCI properties under _Transformation_.

**Filter Scripts** (for DCIs)::
Decide whether to accept or reject collected values.

**Event Processing Policy**::
React to events with custom logic in EPP rules.

**Object Tools**::
Create custom actions available from object context menus.

== Script Structure

NXSL scripts can be as simple as a single expression or more structured with functions:

[source,c]
----
// Simple script - just statements
x = 5;
y = 10;
println("Sum: " .. (x + y));
----

For more complex scripts, define a `main()` function:

[source,c]
----
function main()
{
    println("Script started");
    result = calculate(5, 10);
    println("Result: " .. result);
    return 0;
}

function calculate(a, b)
{
    return a * b;
}
----

== Comments

Document your code with comments:

[source,c]
----
// Single-line comment

/*
   Multi-line comment
   spanning several lines
*/

x = 5; // Inline comment
----

== Basic Input and Output

**Output:**

* `println(text)` - Print with newline
* `print(text)` - Print without newline
* `trace(level, text)` - Debug output (level 1-9)

**Script Parameters:**

Scripts receive parameters through special variables `$1`, `$2`, etc.:

[source,c]
----
// If script called with parameters "hello" and "world"
println($1);  // Prints: hello
println($2);  // Prints: world
----

== Your First Practical Script

Let's write a script that does something useful - converting a UNIX timestamp to human-readable format:

[source,c]
----
// Transform UNIX timestamp to readable date
// Use as transformation script for timestamp DCIs

if ($1 == null)
    return null;

return strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", $1);
----

This script:

1. Checks if input (`$1`) is null
2. Uses `strftime` to format the timestamp
3. Returns the formatted string

== Error Handling Basics

Always consider what happens when things go wrong:

[source,c]
----
value = GetDCIValue($node, 123);
if (value == null)
{
    trace(1, "Failed to get DCI value");
    return null;
}
println("Value: " .. value);
----

Key practices:

* Check for `null` after operations that might fail
* Use `trace()` for debugging information
* Return appropriate values for error conditions
