Syntactically, NXSL looks similar to Perl or C. Here's simple NXSL program:

[source,c]
----
/* sample program */
println("Hello!");
----

This program will print word ``Hello`` on screen. Code outside functions is automatically executed by the interpreter.

Now we'll analyze this program:

[source,c]
----
/* sample program */
----

Everything inside ``/* */`` is considered a comment and will be ignored by
interpreter. You can enclose comments, like below:

[source,c]
----
/* comment /* another comment */ still comment */
----

You can also use single line comments:

[source,c]
----
x = 1; // everything between two slashes and end of line is a comment
----

== Functions

A function is a part of a program that can be called by other parts of the program. A function definition always has the following form: 

[source,c]
----
function name(parameters)
{
    // the function code goes here
}
----


The function can return a value to the caller and accept zero or more
parameters.

NOTE: In older scripts, you may see an explicit `main()` function. This is no longer required - the interpreter automatically wraps code outside functions into an implicit `$main()`. The explicit `main()` function is still supported for backward compatibility, but be aware that defining `main()` will cause any top-level code to be ignored.

The function name follows the rules for all names (formally: identifiers): it
must consist entirely of letters (uppercase and lowercase are different!),
digits, underscores (``_``) and dollar signs (``$``), but may not begin with a
digit. Please note that most special identifiers starts with dollar sign
(``$``), so it is recommended not to start your identifiers with it.

First line in function code looks like

[source,c]
----
println("Hello!");
----

In this line, ``println`` is an embedded operator which prints given string to
standard output with carriage return, and ``"Hello!"`` is a string we want to
print. Please note semicolon at the end of line – it's a separator between
operators. Each operator should end with semicolon.

The next, and final, line of our small program is: 

[source,c]
----
return 0;
----

``return`` is another built-in operator which exits the function and sets it's
return value.
